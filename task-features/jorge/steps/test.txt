  As a user

  In order to manipulate lists
  Scenario Outline: GET all lists in a board -- @1.1                       # lists.feature:13
    Given I send a GET request to /boards/"627c0cb01e98336259fa1ae4"/lists # steps/lists_steps.py:6
    When I receive a response with at least one list                       # steps/lists_steps.py:12
    Then the status code is "200"                                          # steps/lists_steps.py:16
